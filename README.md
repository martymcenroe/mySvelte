# mySvelte
just working through the tutorial and posting the code, also some conversations with my LLM buddies

https://svelte.dev/tutorial/svelte/welcome-to-svelte

From the tutorial:
============
This tutorial is split into four main parts:

    Basic Svelte (you are here)
    Advanced Svelte
    Basic SvelteKit
    Advanced SvelteKit

Each section will present an exercise designed to illustrate a feature. Later exercises build on the knowledge gained in earlier ones, so itâ€™s recommended that you go from start to finish. If necessary, you can navigate via the menu above.

============

1. organize into folders
2. number all lessons sequentially from beginning
3. post the initial problem in a file with .ts extension
4. post any LLM conversations additiaonal learnings in a same-named and same-numbered file with *.md extension

5. N.B. ChatGPT gives answers to HTML/CSS/JS questions that get rendered inconsistently by Firefox and one expects, other browsers. The only way to solve this is to man-up and use the API and receive the response back in JSON. That will be another repo on this long-deferred step-up.

There is no actual need for me to copy this code since it is already in 
https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte.dev/tree/main
it's just an internal discipline to stay focused and work through the tutorial
