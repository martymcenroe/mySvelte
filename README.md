# mySvelte
just working through the tutorial and posting the code, also some conversations with my LLM buddies

https://svelte.dev/tutorial/svelte/welcome-to-svelte

1. organize into folders
2. number all lessons sequentially from beginning
3. post the initial problem in a file with .ts extension
4. post any LLM conversations additiaonal learnings in a same-named and same-numbered file with *.md extension

5. N.B. ChatGPT gives answers to HTML/CSS/JS questions that get rendered inconsistently by Firefox and one expects, other browsers. The only way to solve this is to man-up and use the API and receive the response back in JSON. That will be another repo on this long-deferred step-up.
